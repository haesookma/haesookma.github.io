Borders were closed, and social distancing measures were implemented to prevent the spread of the disease. Almost all businesses were affected, but the tourism industry was one of the hardest hit. It is because of the unique feature of the tourism industry, where human contact is inevitable (Park and Park, 2020). Thus, the pandemic has made the tourism market unpredicatable.</p><p>In this fast changing environment, data can help us achieve better marketing plans. This study describes how data can be used to effectively achieve marketing plans in the context of unprecedented changes in the external business environment. First, I outline how we can understand the tourism market changes by observing up-to-date data. Second, the data can be used to evaluate marketing efforts. Lastly, I discuss how tourism market forecasting can be done with data.</p><p>--</p><h2 id="the-number-of-outdoor-&amp;-indoor-tourists-by-province">The number of Outdoor &amp; Indoor Tourists by province</h2><p>The following plots show the number of tourist by category by province.

The data showed that both “outdoor” and “indoor” tourists have decreased. Additionally, before COVID-19, there was a relatively constant  trend in the number of tourists throughout the year, but that has changed. Prior to the pandemic, the tourist spots under “social” subcategory was the most popular, but “nature” became the most popular during the pandemic.</p><p>One of the interesting findings is that the number of tourists under “social” subcategory began to increase from January 2021. It could be explained by the people’s desire to connect with others (Cheung et al. 2021). Due to social distancing, people have been encouraged to stay home and kept a distance from each other. Since government regulations lasted longer than expected, people began to travel again with safety precautions.</p><strong>Performance Indicator - Evaluating the marketing efforts by data</strong><p>Data can be used as a performance indicator, and the “untact” tourism market spots are used as an example in this study. The Korea Tourism Organization conducted a marketing campaign to select and promote 100 “untact” tourism spots in 2020. According to the data, these spots attracted more tourists than other spots. Therefore, the growth rate of tourists in “untact” tourist spots could be used as one of the indicators to evaluate the performance.</p><strong>Future Prediction - Forecasting the tourism market</strong><p>The tourism market trend has changed since the first COVID-19 confirmed case in January 2020. Because of the government’s travel restrictions and social distancing measures, it is true that the tourism demand itself has decreased. Cheung et al. (2021) pointed out that safety became the most important factor to consider in terms of travel during the pandemic. However, since the pandemic has lasted longer than expected, people were eager to travel although they cared about the safety the most. As previous data analysis showed, people tend to prefer “outdoor” activities in pursuit of “social” gatherings. The new trend would likely continue for some time until the safety concerns are eliminated, so it can be incorporated into the upcoming marketing plans.</p><h2 id="reference">Reference</h2><ul><li>Cheung, C., Takashima, M., Choi, H.
