The data showed that both outdoor and indoor tourists have decreased. Also, before the COVID-19, there was a certain trend in the number of tourists, but that has changed. Prior to the pandemic, the tourist spots under social sub_category was the most popular, but nature became the first.</p><p>One of the interesting findings is that the number of tourists under social sub-category began to increase from January 2021. It could be explained by the people’s desire to connect with others. Due to social distancing, people have been encouraged to stay home and keep having a distance from each other. Since government regulations lasted longer than expected, people began to travel again with safety precautions.</p><strong>Performance Indicator - Evaluating the marketing efforts by data</strong><p>Data can be used as a performance indicator, and the untact tourism market spots are used as an example in this study. Korea Tourism Organization conducted a marketing campaign to select and promote 100 untact tourism spots in 2020. According to the data, these spots attracted more tourists than other spots. Therefore, the growth rate of tourists in untact tourist spots could be used as one of the indicators to evaluate the performance.</p><strong>Future Prediction - Forecasting the tourism market</strong><p>The tourism market trend has changed since the first COVID-19 confirmed case in January 2020. Because of the government’s travel restrictions and social distancing measures, it is true that the tourism demand itself has decreased. However, since the pandemic has lasted longer, people are eager to travel although their preferences have somewhat changed. As previous data analysis showed, people tend to prefer outdoor activities in pursuit of social gathering. The new trend would continue for some time until the safety concerns are eliminated, so it can be incorporated into the upcoming marketing plans.</p><h2 id="reference">Reference</h2><ul><li>Korea Tourism Organization.
